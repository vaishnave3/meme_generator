# Meme Generator

This project was built completely using Reactjs.

## Features of this website 

In the website, you can:

### Generate a random popular meme template
Out of the top 100 meme templates of the year, one is randomly chosen and rendered to the site.

### Add your own caption to it

A top text and a bottom text can be added.

### Adjust the text 
Using the four arrow buttons, adjust the top and bottom text placement on the screen.

### Download the meme template

You can download the template to your local machine and work with it later, as you please.


### Screenshot and share with your friends!!!



#### Features that I will add to the site at a later time :
- Adjust text size as the user wishes.
- Download name automatically changed to the meme template's name.
- Upload your own template from files and add captions to it.
